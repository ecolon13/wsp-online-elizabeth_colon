<h1>Site Intent</h1>
<p align="justify">Signs by design have designed a web page that allows the public to become familiar with the services they provide.  They are promoting fabrication, installation, and repairing all types of business signs.The entire page needs to be redesigned to begin the branding process of this company. Signs by Design need a logo, a different color scheme that is not so over powering with the contents. The layout needs to be redesigned to allow the users to have a more positive   experience as they navigate through the site.  The most important aspect of this site is to have an effective gallery of that can illustrate the wide range of services they provide. This will allow the consumer to make the determination of what sets them aside from other sign companies. Social networks are also a great tool to promote your site, so I will integrate a link to facebook, and twitter. 
  A contact form will need to be designed to allow the users to put their contact information so Signs by design can contact them. </p>
